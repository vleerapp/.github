## Roadmap

For now we are focusing on building a good and stable local music player with Vleer before expanding it by implementing the OpenMusic API Spec, which is also being developed simultaneously alongside a reference implementation in Go that just serves a local folder over the API.

- [ ] Stable local music player
- [ ] OpenMusic API 1.0
- [ ] Go Reference Implemenatation
- [ ] Integration of OpenMusic API into Vleer
- [ ] Testing & Validation, OpenMusic API
